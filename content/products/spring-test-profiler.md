  ## Slow and Unpredictable Test Suites Are Killing Your Productivity

  Are you tired of waiting for your Spring Boot test suite to complete? Do you struggle with:

  - **Test suites that take 15+ minutes to run**, slowing down your development cycle
  - **Flaky tests that fail randomly**, breaking your CI/CD pipeline without clear reasons  
  - **No visibility into which tests are actually slow** or consuming the most resources
  - **Unclear test dependencies** that make it hard to understand why tests fail together
  - **Poor test coverage insights** that leave critical code paths untested
  - **No actionable insights** on how to optimize your test performance

  Every minute spent waiting for tests is a minute not spent building features your users need. Poor test performance doesn't just slow you down‚Äîit creates a culture where developers skip running tests locally, leading to more bugs in production.
