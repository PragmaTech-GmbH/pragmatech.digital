## Talk Overview

Engineering teams using AI tools write code faster than ever, but deployment confidence often lags behind. This practical talk shows how to build Spring Boot testing strategies that complement AI development, ensuring your team can ship quickly without sacrificing quality. 

Learn testing patterns that catch AI-generated issues early and establish the confidence needed for frequent, fearless deployments.

## What You'll Learn

This presentation covers the essential testing strategies for modern Spring Boot applications in the AI era:

**The AI Testing Challenge**

- Common AI-Generated Code Issues: Subtle bugs, outdated patterns, missing edge cases
- Where Traditional Testing Falls Short:  Legacy approaches can't keep pace with AI velocity
- The Confidence Gap: Why faster coding doesn't equal faster shipping

**Testing Architecture for AI-Era Development**

- The Testing Pyramid Reimagined: Unit, integration, and contract testing priorities
- AI-Resilient Test Design: Writing tests that survive AI refactoring
- Live Demo: Setting up a robust Spring Boot testing foundation
- Code Example: Test structure that catches AI-generated issues

**Practical Testing Strategies**

- Smart Unit Testing: Focus on business logic, not implementation details
- Integration Testing That Matters: Database, external APIs, and Spring context
- Contract Testing: Ensuring AI-generated changes don't break integrations

**Building Deployment Confidence**

- Automated Safety Nets: CI/CD pipelines that catch issues before production
- Monitoring and Observability: Detecting problems AI testing missed
- Team Practices: Code review strategies for AI-assisted development

## Target Audience

Engineering managers, CTOs, and technical directors leading Spring Boot development teams who are using or considering AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot. 

These decision-makers face the challenge of teams coding faster with AI but deploying with less confidence due to testing gaps. They have budget authority or significant influence over testing strategies and are looking for practical solutions to maintain code quality while maximizing AI productivity gains. 

The audience typically works in 5-500 person engineering organizations with Spring Boot applications in production and wants proven approaches to deploy frequently without fear.

## Talk Format

This is a hands-on presentation featuring live coding demonstrations and real-world examples. We'll work through actual scenarios of AI-testing Spring Boot applications, showing both successful strategies and common pitfalls to avoid.

The session includes interactive elements and Q&A, and can be customized for different audience levels and time constraints (45-90 minutes available).

## Delivery History

This cutting-edge talk addresses one of the most current challenges in software development. The content evolves rapidly to incorporate the latest developments in AI tooling and Spring ecosystem updates.

Audiences appreciate the balance between theoretical understanding and actionable techniques they can implement immediately in their projects.
