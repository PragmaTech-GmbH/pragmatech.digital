## Talk Overview

The integration of AI and machine learning capabilities into Spring Boot applications brings new testing challenges that traditional approaches don't address. This talk provides a comprehensive guide to testing AI-powered Spring Boot applications with confidence.

We'll explore the unique testing requirements that emerge when your application communicates with AI services, processes ML models, or handles large datasets. The session combines theoretical foundations with practical demonstrations, showing real-world testing strategies that work in production environments.

## What You'll Learn

This presentation covers the essential testing strategies for modern Spring Boot applications in the AI era:

**AI Integration Testing:**
- Testing external AI service integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Handling API rate limits and timeouts in tests
- Mocking AI responses for consistent test execution
- Contract testing for AI service dependencies

**Data & Pipeline Testing:**
- Validating data quality and preprocessing pipelines
- Testing data transformations and feature engineering
- Handling large datasets in test environments
- Ensuring data privacy and security in tests

**ML Model Testing:**
- Testing model inference endpoints and performance
- Validating model predictions and confidence scores
- Handling non-deterministic AI behavior in tests
- Version management for ML models in CI/CD

**Advanced Testing Strategies:**
- Performance testing for AI-heavy workloads
- Load testing ML inference endpoints
- Monitoring and observability for AI features
- Testing fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation

**Spring AI Ecosystem:**
- Leveraging Spring AI for testable AI integrations
- Testing vector databases and embedding operations
- Validating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations

## Target Audience

This talk is perfect for development teams that are integrating AI capabilities into their Spring Boot applications or planning to do so. Whether you're building chatbots, recommendation systems, data processing pipelines, or any AI-enhanced features, you'll learn how to maintain quality and reliability.

Ideal for teams struggling with testing AI integrations, handling non-deterministic behavior, or ensuring performance at scale with ML workloads.

## Talk Format

This is a hands-on presentation featuring live coding demonstrations and real-world examples. We'll work through actual scenarios of testing AI-integrated Spring Boot applications, showing both successful strategies and common pitfalls to avoid.

The session includes interactive elements and Q&A, and can be customized for different audience levels and time constraints (45-90 minutes available).

## Delivery History

This cutting-edge talk addresses one of the most current challenges in software development. It has been well-received at major conferences for its practical approach to a complex topic. The content evolves rapidly to incorporate the latest developments in AI tooling and Spring ecosystem updates.

Audiences appreciate the balance between theoretical understanding and actionable techniques they can implement immediately in their projects.
