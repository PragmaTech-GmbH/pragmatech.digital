## Talk Overview

Your test suite shouldn't slow you down or give you false confidence. Instead, it should be a powerful tool that helps you deliver high-quality software faster.

Spring Boot's testing ecosystem can feel overwhelming with its numerous annotations, test slices, and configuration options. This talk cuts through the complexity by focusing on practical testing strategies that actually work in production applications.

Rather than covering every testing annotation available, we'll focus on building a coherent testing strategy that balances **speed, reliability, and maintainability**. 

## Talk Description

Testing plays a crucial role in software development, allowing you to catch bugs, ensure your code functions as intended, and provide confidence in the reliability and stability of your applications.

However, testing Spring Boot applications can sometimes feel like navigating a labyrinth of challenges â€“ from managing dependencies and external systems to crafting effective tests that reflect the behavior of your code.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey with Spring Boot, this talk is designed to unravel the complexities and pitfalls of testing Spring Boot applications and empower you to become more productive and confident in your testing efforts.

In this talk, we will demystify testing Spring Boot applications by providing you with clear explanations, practical insights, and actionable best practices. Philip will guide you through the common pitfalls faced by developers, share time-tested recipes for success, and equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to write comprehensive and effective tests.

## Target Audience

This talk is designed for developers who want to move beyond basic testing and build robust, maintainable test suites for their Spring Boot applications. Whether you're new to Spring Boot testing or looking to improve your existing approach, you'll gain practical insights you can apply immediately.

Perfect for teams that are struggling with slow Spring Boot test suites, brittle integration tests, or unclear testing strategies.

## Talk Format

This is an interactive presentation that combines theory with live coding demonstrations. We'll work through real examples, showing both the problems and solutions. 

The session includes time for Q&A and can be adapted for different time slots (30-60 minutes).

## Delivery History

This talk has been successfully delivered at major conferences and [local meetups across Europe and the US](/events). 

It consistently receives positive feedback for its practical approach and clear explanations of complex testing concepts. 

The content is regularly updated to reflect the latest Spring Boot features and testing best practices.
