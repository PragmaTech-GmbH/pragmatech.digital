## Talk Overview

Spring Boot's testing ecosystem can feel overwhelming with its numerous annotations, test slices, and configuration options. This talk cuts through the complexity by focusing on practical testing strategies that actually work in production applications.

Rather than covering every testing annotation available, we'll focus on building a coherent testing strategy that balances speed, reliability, and maintainability. You'll learn when to use unit tests, integration tests, and everything in between.

## What You'll Learn

This presentation provides a comprehensive guide to testing Spring Boot applications effectively:

**Testing Strategy & Architecture:**
- How to structure your test suite for maximum effectiveness
- Understanding the testing pyramid in the context of Spring Boot
- Choosing the right testing approach for different scenarios

**Spring Boot Test Slices:**
- Deep dive into @WebMvcTest for web layer testing
- Using @DataJpaTest for repository layer validation
- Leveraging @JsonTest for JSON serialization testing
- When and how to combine test slices effectively

**Integration Testing:**
- Setting up realistic integration tests with TestContainers
- Testing with real databases and external services
- Balancing test isolation with realistic scenarios

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Efficient test data management and cleanup strategies
- Performance optimization for large test suites
- Debugging common test failures and configuration issues

## Target Audience

This talk is designed for developers who want to move beyond basic testing and build robust, maintainable test suites for their Spring Boot applications. Whether you're new to Spring Boot testing or looking to improve your existing approach, you'll gain practical insights you can apply immediately.

Perfect for teams that are struggling with slow tests, brittle integration tests, or unclear testing strategies.

## Talk Format

This is an interactive presentation that combines theory with live coding demonstrations. We'll work through real examples, showing both the problems and solutions. The session includes time for Q&A and can be adapted for different time slots (30-60 minutes).

## Delivery History

This talk has been successfully delivered at major conferences and local meetups across Europe and the US. It consistently receives positive feedback for its practical approach and clear explanations of complex testing concepts. The content is regularly updated to reflect the latest Spring Boot features and testing best practices.
