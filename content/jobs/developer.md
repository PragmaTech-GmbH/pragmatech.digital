## About the Role

At PragmaTech, we're passionate about helping developers build better software through effective testing practices. As a Java Developer specializing in testing, you'll be a key member of our team, creating educational content and providing hands-on consulting to help companies implement robust testing strategies.

This is a remote position, but we prefer candidates in European time zones to facilitate collaboration with our core team and clients.

## What You'll Do

In this role, you'll wear multiple hats - part educator, part consultant, and part developer. You'll create content that helps developers improve their testing skills, while also working directly with clients to implement effective testing practices in their projects.

Your expertise will influence how hundreds of development teams approach testing, leading to more reliable software and more confident developers.

## Who You Are

You're a Java developer who genuinely enjoys writing tests and helping others improve their testing practices. You understand that good tests are not just about code coverage, but about providing confidence and fast feedback to developers.

You're able to explain complex technical concepts in clear, approachable ways, and you enjoy sharing your knowledge with others. You're also curious and always looking to learn new techniques and tools to improve your craft.

## Our Interview Process

1. **Initial application review**
2. **30-minute video call** with our team lead
3. **Technical assessment** - a small task related to testing Spring Boot applications
4. **Final interview** with the team

We aim to make our interview process respectful of your time while still allowing both sides to evaluate fit. We'll keep you informed at every step and provide feedback regardless of outcome.

If you're passionate about testing and want to help developers build more reliable software, we'd love to hear from you!
