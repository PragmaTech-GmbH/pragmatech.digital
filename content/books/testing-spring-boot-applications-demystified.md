## About This Book

Testing separates reliable applications from buggy disasters. Yet many developers struggle with Spring Boot testing, facing confusing configurations, slow test suites, and uncertainty about what to test.

This book cuts through the complexity with practical, battle-tested strategies that will help you:

- Write tests that catch bugs early
- Build comprehensive test suites that run fast
- Ship code with confidence
- Transform testing from a "necessary evil" into your competitive advantage

## What You'll Learn

### Testing Fundamentals
Master the core concepts of testing in Spring Boot projects, understanding when and how to apply different testing strategies.

### Sliced Testing Techniques
Learn how to use Spring Boot's test slices (`@WebMvcTest`, `@DataJpaTest`, etc.) to create fast, focused tests that isolate specific layers of your application.

### Integration Testing
Discover how to write effective integration tests with `@SpringBootTest` that verify your entire system works correctly together.

### Configuration and Best Practices
Understand test configuration strategies, avoid common pitfalls, and implement best practices that keep your test suite maintainable and reliable.
