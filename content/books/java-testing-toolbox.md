faqs:
  - question: "Is this book suitable for testing beginners?"
    answer: "Yes, the book starts with testing fundamentals and progressively builds to more advanced topics. If you have basic Java knowledge, you'll be able to follow along and improve your testing skills regardless of your current level."
  
  - question: "What makes this book different from other testing books?"
    answer: "Most testing books focus on either theory or a specific library. The Java Testing Toolbox covers the complete ecosystem of modern Java testing tools with a practical approach, showing how they work together in real-world scenarios."
  
  - question: "Does the book cover Spring Boot testing?"
    answer: "While this book focuses on the core Java testing libraries that are framework-agnostic, it does include examples of how these tools integrate with Spring Boot. For comprehensive Spring Boot testing, check out our dedicated book 'Testing Spring Boot Applications'."
  
  - question: "Are the code examples available for download?"
    answer: "Yes, all code examples from the book are available in a GitHub repository, allowing you to experiment with the concepts as you read."
