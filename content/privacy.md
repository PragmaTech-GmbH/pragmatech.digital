## 4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

### 4.1 Essential Cookies

We use cookies that are necessary for the operation of our website. These cookies are essential for the basic functions of our website and cannot be disabled. The use of these cookies is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) to provide you with a functioning website.

### 4.2 Analytics

We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics uses cookies that allow us to analyze how users use our site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website is usually transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. We have activated IP anonymization, so your IP address will be truncated within the European Union or other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there.

Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide us with other services relating to website and internet usage. The processed data may be used to create pseudonymous user profiles.

The use of Google Analytics is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time by adjusting your cookie settings on our website.

## 5. Data Recipients

We may share your personal data with the following categories of recipients:

- Service providers who act as processors and who provide services such as hosting, email delivery, or payment processing
- Public authorities when required by law

## 6. Data Transfers to Third Countries

Some of our service providers are located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area (third countries). If we transfer personal data to these service providers, we ensure that an adequate level of protection is guaranteed for your data. We typically ensure this by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission.

## 7. Data Retention

We store your personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed or as required by law. For example, we store contract data (including billing information) for the duration of the contract and for the legally required retention periods (usually 6 to 10 years for tax and commercial law reasons).

## 9. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The current version of the privacy policy is always available on our website.

## 10. Data Security

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 11. Automated Decision Making and Profiling

We do not use automated decision-making or profiling.

## 12. Obligation to Provide Personal Data

The provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g., information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that you provide us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. For example, you are obliged to provide us with personal data when our company concludes a contract with you. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with you could not be concluded.
