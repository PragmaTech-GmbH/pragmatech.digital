## About This Talk

The Java User Group Zürich is excited to host PragmaTech's testing expert for an evening dedicated to modern Spring Boot testing approaches. We'll cover:

- Modern testing strategies for Spring Boot applications
- Testing slices and their benefits
- Integration vs. unit testing considerations
- Practical demos and real-world examples
- Speed up Spring test suites by making the most of Spring TestContext context caching

## Location

The event will be held at our usual meetup location in central Zürich. Food and drinks will be provided.

## Registration

This talk is free to attend but registration through the JUG Zürich Meetup page is required due to limited space.
