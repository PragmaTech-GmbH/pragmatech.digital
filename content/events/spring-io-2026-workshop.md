## Workshop Overview

Take your Spring Boot testing skills beyond the basics. This hands-on workshop covers advanced techniques for writing reliable, fast, and maintainable tests. You'll learn how to leverage Testcontainers for realistic database and service testing, optimize test execution through strategic context caching, and build robust tests for external service dependencies. We'll also explore mutation testing to verify your tests actually catch bugs - not just achieve code coverage. Walk away with practical patterns you can apply to your projects immediately.

## Agenda

- Test slices and context management in Spring Boot
- Testcontainers: setup, configuration, and best practices
- Context caching strategies for faster test suites
- Testing external services: WireMock, contract testing, and resilience verification
- Mutation testing with PIT: measuring real test effectiveness
- Performance optimization and test organization patterns

## Goals

- Confidently use Testcontainers for database and infrastructure testing
- Understand and optimize Spring context caching behavior
- Apply proven strategies for testing external service integrations
- Use mutation testing to identify weak spots in your test suite
- Reduce test execution time without sacrificing quality

## Target Audience

Java developers with basic Spring Boot testing experience who want to write more comprehensive and effective tests. Familiarity with JUnit 5 and Spring Boot fundamentals is expected.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop with Java 21+ and your favorite IDE
- Basic Spring Boot knowledge
- Git installed to access workshop materials
