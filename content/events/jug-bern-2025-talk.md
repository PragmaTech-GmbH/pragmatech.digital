- Testing slices and their benefits
- Integration vs. unit testing considerations
- Practical demos and real-world examples
- Speed up Spring test suites by making the most of Spring TestContext context caching

## Location

The event will be held at our usual meetup location in central Bern. Food and drinks will be provided.
