## Workshop Overview

This hands-on, one-day workshop teaches developers how to effectively apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Spring Boot applications. Unlike theoretical TDD courses, this workshop focuses on practical, real-world examples that reflect the challenges of modern enterprise applications.

You'll learn how to write tests first for Spring components, work with databases, handle external dependencies, and organize tests for maintainability and speed. Throughout the day, you'll build a small but complete Spring Boot application using TDD principles, giving you a solid foundation to bring these practices back to your team.

### Who Should Attend

This workshop is designed for:
- Java developers working with Spring Boot who want to adopt TDD
- Teams struggling with slow or brittle test suites
- Developers who understand testing basics but struggle to apply TDD in real-world Spring Boot scenarios
- Technical leads looking to improve their team's testing practices

Participants should have basic familiarity with Spring Boot and Java. No prior TDD experience is required.

### Workshop Format

The workshop is structured as a highly interactive, hands-on experience:

- **Morning Session**: Foundational concepts and initial exercises applying TDD to Spring Boot components
- **Afternoon Session**: Advanced topics and completion of a mini-project using TDD practices
- **Throughout the Day**: Coding exercises, discussions, and real-time feedback

The workshop can be delivered either on-site at your location or remotely via video conferencing software. All participants need a development environment with Java and an IDE.

### Prerequisites

Technical requirements:
- Java 17 or later
- Your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
- Git client
- Maven or Gradle

Knowledge prerequisites:
- Basic Spring Boot concepts
- Fundamentals of Java programming
- Familiarity with REST APIs
