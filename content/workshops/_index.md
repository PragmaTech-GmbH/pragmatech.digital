    quote: "Had a great time at the Testing Spring Boot Applications Demystified workshop! I learned a ton including new concepts like slice testing and test containers.<br><br>The in-depth explanations helped me finally understand tools I'd used without fully grasping, and I'm walking away with concrete ideas I will implement with my team.<br><br>I also really appreciated the philosophy that testing is not all about achieving a certain coverage threshold, but about having the confidence to release on a Friday afternoon."
