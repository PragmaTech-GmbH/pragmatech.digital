## Workshop Overview

**Java Testing Jumpstart: From Zero to Hero** is a comprehensive two-day workshop designed specifically for Java developers who want to build a solid foundation in automated testing. Whether you're new to testing or looking to formalize your knowledge of the Java testing ecosystem, this workshop provides hands-on experience with the essential tools every Java developer should master.

Over two intensive days, you'll learn how to effectively use JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers, WireMock, and AssertJ to create robust, maintainable test suites for your applications. Through a carefully designed progression of concepts and hands-on exercises, you'll develop practical skills you can immediately apply in your daily work.

### Who Should Attend

This workshop is perfect for:
- Junior to mid-level Java developers with limited testing experience
- Self-taught developers looking to fill gaps in their testing knowledge
- Teams wanting to establish a common testing foundation
- Developers transitioning to Java from other languages
- Computer science graduates entering professional development

No previous testing experience is required, but participants should have basic Java programming skills.

### Workshop Format

The workshop follows a structured, hands-on approach:

- **Interactive Lectures**: Concise explanations of key concepts with live demonstrations
- **Guided Exercises**: Step-by-step implementation of testing techniques
- **Practical Challenges**: Real-world testing scenarios to solve independently or in pairs
- **Code Reviews**: Collaborative review of solutions with best practice discussions
- **Progressive Project**: Building a complete test suite for a sample application

The workshop can be delivered either on-site at your location or remotely via video conferencing. All exercises are designed to work seamlessly in both formats.

### Prerequisites

Technical requirements:
- Java 11 or later installed
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate) or Eclipse
- Git client
- Maven or Gradle
- Internet access for downloading dependencies

Knowledge prerequisites:
- Basic Java syntax and concepts
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming
- Experience writing simple Java applications
